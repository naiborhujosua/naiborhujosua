# Hi, I'm Josua Naiborhu :indonesia:ðŸ‘‹ðŸŽ“ðŸ’» 

I'm a business analyst who is transitioning into decision scientist. I love creating technology to elevate people and building community. I am part of One Year Scholarship of Data Science python track which is initialized by [Facebook Developer Circle](https://developers.facebook.com/developercircles/) for anyone who is interested in Data science through [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/josuanaiborhu94). Some technologies I enjoy learning with include Python, PostgreSQL,Tableau, and PySpark.

[**My Notes on taking Data Science Courses**](https://github.com/naiborhujosua/MyNotes-for-Data-Science-Workshop) is a repository  about my journey of being a data scientist. I try to summarize all the contents in this repository. All of the contents are the statistical concepts, visualization libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn and machine learning algorithms in Python.
