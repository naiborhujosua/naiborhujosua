# Hi, I'm Josua Naiborhu 👋🏾‍💻

I'm a business analyst who is transitioning into data science. I love creating technology to elevate people, and building community. I am part of One Year Scholarship of Data Science python track which is initialized by Facebook Developer Circle for anyone who is interested in Data science. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Python, SQL, and Tableau.
