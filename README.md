<p align="center"> I think AI is akin to building a rocket ship. You need a huge engine and a
lot of fuel. If you have a large engine and a tiny amount of fuel, you won’t
make it to orbit. If you have a tiny engine and a ton of fuel, you can’t even
lift off. To build a rocket you need a huge engine and a lot of fuel.
