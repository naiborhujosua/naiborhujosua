# Hi, I'm Josua Naiborhu üëãüèæ‚Äçüíª

I'm a business analyst who is transitioning into data scientist. I love creating technology to elevate people and building community. I am part of One Year Scholarship of Data Science python track which is initialized by Facebook Developer Circle for anyone who is interested in Data science through [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/josuanaiborhu94). Some technologies I enjoy working with include Python, SQL,Tableau, and Django.

[**My Notes on taking Data Science Courses**](https://github.com/naiborhujosua/MyNotes-for-Data-Science-Workshop) is a repository  about my journey of being data scientist. I try to summarize all the contents in this repository. All of the contents are based on Python and all the statistical libraries and visualization libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
