# Hi, I'm Josua Naiborhu üëãüèæ‚Äçüíª

I'm a business analyst transitioning into data scientist. I love creating technology to elevate people and building community. I am part of One Year Scholarship of Data Science python track which is initialized by Facebook Developer Circle for anyone who is interested in Data science through [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/josuanaiborhu94). Some technologies I enjoy working with include Python, PostgreSQL,Tableau, and Django.
