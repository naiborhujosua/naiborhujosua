# Hi, I'm Josua Naiborhu 👋🏾‍💻

I'm a business analyst who is transitioning into data scientist. I love creating technology to elevate people and building community. I am part of One Year Scholarship of Data Science python track which is initialized by Facebook Developer Circle for anyone who is interested in Data science through [Datacamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/"). I also summarize all of my learning contents on this <a href="https://github.com/naiborhujosua/MyNotes-for-Data-Science-Workshop">Repository</a>. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Python, SQL,Tableau, and Django.
